Release notes for version 1.0.280:


This release includes enhancements to support limit switches for Motor 1.  Updates are prepared for
both the MCU firmware and Android app.

Please install the following firmware:
    https://jfcenterprises.cloudant.com/transfer/hive-1.0.280/hive.bin



The hardware wiring is already available on the board, and the limit switches should be attached per
this diagram:

Wiring note: Care must be taken to ensure that the positive limit switch is installed on the right
side of the target object's motion.  If these are installed backwards, the software will be confused.
So, I suggest first moving the motor in the positive direction, then install the positive limit
switch further along the screw in that direction.  Of course, reverse the process for the negative
limit switch.



Finally, the Android app should be updated to version 1.11.  The Google Play Store link for alpha
access is:

Enhancements:
  - The firmware now manages Motor 1 a bit differently.  When it is anywhere in between the 2 limits,
  it moves the same as the other motors, but when either limit switch is closed, movement stops
  immediately, and the fact that it has hit the limit is reported to the app.
  - For Motor 1, the app will always report one of: {moving, stopped, @pos-limit, @neg-limit}.
  - Clicking on the Motor 1 button will give a slightly different dialog than for the other motors.
  On this dialog, you can instruct the motor to move a particular distance (click +, -, or type in
  a number), or instruct it to move all the way to either limit.



For uploading the firmware:
   It's the same process as before to place the firmware on the MCU module.  Download the file, connect
   your PC to the USB, put the MCU in firmware upload mode (double-press the tiny button next to the
   USB connector), then run the bossac program as before.   I think I've written about this process
   a couple times; here's one of them:
