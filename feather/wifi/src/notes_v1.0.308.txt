Release notes for version 1.0.308:


This release fixes some timing bugs discovered in firmware while debuging an sd card
corruption.  The timing problems may not be related to the corruption.  The App also has
some minor changes to prevent the suspected situation from happening in the future.

Please install the following firmware:
    https://jfcenterprises.cloudant.com/transfer/hive-1.0.308/hive.bin


The Android app should be updated to version 1.13.  The Google Play Store link for alpha
access is:
    https://play.google.com/apps/testing/com.jfc.apps.hive



Enhancements:
  - The App now will prevent attempts to run any of the motors at the same time as the Audio
  sampling.  It does so by immediately setting the state to "pending", then waiting for the
  controller to respond with the system status.  The buttons will remain locked until the
  controller reports that all activity finishes.


Bug Fixes:
  - Bugs discovered with incorrect error messages on the App when attempting to clear the cmd
  queue were fixed.


For uploading the firmware:
   It's the same process as before to place the firmware on the MCU module.  Download the file, connect
   your PC to the USB, put the MCU in firmware upload mode (double-press the tiny button next to the
   USB connector), then run the bossac program as before.   I think I've written about this process
   a couple times; here's one of them:
