Release notes for version 1.0.231:

This release includes fixes to several significant fixes on the MCU and several minor fixes on the Android App.

[JFC]  The MCU upgrade can be done without necessarily upgrading the Android app.


Please plan on installing the following firmware as soon as you change to the wifi MCU:
   https://jfcenterprises.cloudant.com/transfer/hive-1.0.231/hive.bin

   It's the same process as before to place the firmware on the MCU module.  Download the file,
   connect your PC to the USB, put the MCU in firmware upload mode (double-press the tiny button
   next to the USB connector), then run the bossac program as before.

   I think I've written about this process a couple times; here's one of them:

Also, please update the Android app to version 1.8.  The Google Play Store link for alpha access is:

Fixes:
  - A problem that left the MCU stuck in AP-mode has been found and fixed.
  - The App's Uptime property was red in many situations where it shouldn't have been.  This has been
  corrected, though there may still be very brief flashes of red until it settles (like when the app
  is first opened).


Enhancements:
  - Added a feature to the Android app that allows the user to view the command queue.  It also allows
  the user to clear the queue.  It shows all of the commands back to the last time the queue was cleared,
  whether the MCU has acted on them or not.  See "Pending Cmds" on the app's setting screen.
  - The standard communication transaction cycle has been reduced by keeping a constant active Wifi
  connection:
        1) establish Wifi connection  <<<< removed
	2) connect to db server
	3) initiate http operation
	4) consume result
	5) shutdown db connection
	6) shutdown wifi connnection  <<<< removed
	
   (Except when a timeout or error is detected; at those points everything is shutdown and re-attempted
   from scratch.)
	
   This leads to slightly more responsiveness from the point of view of the Android App user -- though
   still not as good as I hoped (yet).
